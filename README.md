Hey all! I'm CyberAndChill. You may know me from X with my occasional quips on I.T. career musings. If you've followed me long enough, you know that I have a consulting role in tech which allows me to have an understanding into almost all aspects of tech. It's a unique position. I interact and speak developer all the way up to the C-Suite. I know people may wonder if my broad acumen negates my technical prowess, I can assure it does not. I have a deep understanding in applicable PKI and cryptography, my background is networks, and I can code! Althought I've never needed to code for work, it is mostly to show that my hobbies lie in all things tech; and has been that way for years.

This portfolio will showcase my expertise and musings of my experience in tech. Enjoy!
